                The US has lost its appeal to international students over past two years. Especially Chinese students.

                The decline in student visas issued makes it seem like there’s a dramatic decline in international students in the US. That’s a bit misleading. A US policy change in 2014 allowed Chinese nationals to renew student visas once every five years instead of every year. The result has been fewer annual applications from Chinese students, who make up about a third of the foreign-student population in the US.

                <p class="label-text super-font">Another factor might be the immigration policy, students are not easy to stay in the US after studying. While other countries, like Canada, Austrilia attract more Chinese to apply for better education. </p>

                <p class="label-text super-font">Over the past decade, the percentage of student visas issued to Chinese suffered a decline after 2015. </p>

                <p class="label-text super-font">The US political policy makes the situation even worse. A number of policies instituted by the Trump Administration aimeing at protecting Americans, have rejected international students from entering the country. </p>
