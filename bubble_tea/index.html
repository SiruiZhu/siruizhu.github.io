                Bubble tea is originally from Taiwan, China. After becoming a hit in Taiwan, bubble tea was embraced throughout Asia. It started to become increasingly available on the East and West Coasts a few years back. </p>

                <p class="body-text sub-font" align="justify">There are more bubble teas in Western countries over the years. Walking in Soho district in Manhattan, you can also see some related shops. </p>

                <p class="body-text sub-font" align="justify">Here, I scraped from Yelp, with all the bubble teas in the New York, get all the reviews and ratings customer gave. Might have some interesting findings.  </p>

                Perhaps the drinkâ€™s most divisive quality is the sensory experience of drinking it. Consumed through wide plastic straws designed to fit a tapioca pearl, roughly half an inch in diameter, the pearls often get stuck in the straw and then rush suddenly into the mouth once released. The texture of the pearls is soft but chewy, while other toppings such as pudding and grass jelly provide a silkier touch with little resistance.</p>
                <p class="body-text sub-font" align="justify">In China, some bubble tea shops also create some other drink with toppings, and very popular online, we called it "wanghongcha" (means popular with online recommendation)

                I selected the good reviews for the top rating stores, doing a tfidf analysis, and be able to have those words. I divided the words into flavor and description words. The larger the bubble is, the more important that world is.
